TODO: Upload MMseqs2 MSA Code. MSAs can be provide in the same format used as Chai-1 (.pqt). But are not automatically created on inference. Need to add this code
TODO: Upload DiscoTope-3.0 Code. Not sure if inverse folding environement used for DiscoTope-3.0 is compatible with Chai-1 package environment. Need to sort this out.
